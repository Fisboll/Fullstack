I know I have tried. I know I have probably shown less to nothing to pass this project. However when the codeanywhere haven't been following the course material and has been forcing me to freerome a lot without much guidance + that this is really horribly explained how it works and not works in the courses itself.

I've barely been able to reach where I am right now because of my Mentor which has helped me a lot. I know I will fail the project... But I've had so many issues with this  code anywhere where its been breaking me out of the databases and preventing me from loading my page beacuse of messages that I couldn't even handle from my own side.
